# multiplication-table

<body>
  <p>This project was created for novice programmers as an applied and educational tool.</p>
  <p>As an example, weâ€™ll take HTML pages with a <b>multiplication table</b> (page 1 - 7).</p>
  <p>In the process of changing the page, various technologies will be added, perhaps to some people they will seem outdated.</p>     
  <p>Everything has its time.</p>
  <br>
  <p><i>P.S.: I ask you not to judge strictly and not to make changes.</i></p>
